While the Unified Checkout is pre-optimized for maximum conversions, it does not restrict you to stick to a one-size-fits-all approach. Using the SDK APIs, you get complete control over modifying the payment experience by,

- üìù **Including new fields to the payment form** on a single processor like Stripe or Braintree
- üí≥ **Prioritizing payment methods** by 90% to add & maintain integrations
- üé® **Switching themes and layouts of checkout page** with full visibility and control

Ways to get started with Hyperswitch:

- Try it in our Sandbox Environment: Fast and easy to
  start.

<a href="https://app.hyperswitch.io/register"><img src="./docs/imgs/get-api-keys.svg" height="35"></a>

- Install in your local system: Configurations and setup required in your system. Suitable if you like to customise the core offering, [learn more](https://github.com/juspay/hyperswitch/blob/main/docs/try_local_system.md)

<a href="#Setup-Instructions">
  <h2 id="Setup Instructions">üõ†Ô∏è Setup Instructions</h2>
</a>

### Setup Node

Check if your machine has node already installed by running the below command on your local machine.

```bash
node -v
```

If your machine does not have node installed in it, you can install it from [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download)

### Clone the repository

Clone the repository from Bitbucket and save in your folder.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/juspay/hyperswitch-web.git
cd hyperswitch-web
```

### Setup the repository

First install all the node modules by running the following command

```bash
npm install
```

Replace the placeholders in /Hyperswitch-react-demo-app/.env publishable key and secret key

```
HYPERSWITCH_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=<GET_THIS_FROM_DASHBOARD>
HYPERSWITCH_SECRET_KEY=<GET_THIS_FROM_DASHBOARD>
```

In the package json file you can see the various scripts you can run.
To start compiling the Rescript code, run the following command. Whenever there is a change in the Rescript code, the compiler will build its adjacent JS code which will be consumed.

```bash
npm run re:start
```

Start the webpack development server by running this command. This will trigger webpack to build a `dist` folder which will contain all the assets and serve it to port localhost:9050 (which you can change from within `webpack.common.js`)

```bash
npm run start
```

You will now get the url http://localhost:9050/HyperLoader.js, which is the script tag.

To see your Web Client functioning you can run the command below, this will open up a playground in which your immediate changes should reflect as you proceed with your development.

```bash
npm run start:playground
```

Now let's test the integration by making a payment from your web client!

### ü§ù Our Belief

> Payments should be open, fast, reliable and affordable to serve
> the billions of people at scale.

Globally payment diversity has been growing at a rapid pace.
There are hundreds of payment processors and new payment methods like BNPL,
RTP etc.
Businesses need to embrace this diversity to increase conversion, reduce cost
and improve control.
But integrating and maintaining multiple processors needs a lot of dev effort.
Why should devs across companies repeat the same work?
Why can't it be unified and reused? Hence, Hyperswitch was born to create that
reusable core and let companies build and customise it as per their specific requirements.

### ‚ú® Our Values

1. Embrace Payments Diversity: It will drive innovation in the ecosystem in
   multiple ways.
2. Make it Open Source: Increases trust; Improves the quality and reusability of
   software.
3. Be community driven: It enables participatory design and development.
4. Build it like Systems Software: This sets a high bar for Reliability,
   Security and Performance SLAs.
5. Maximise Value Creation: For developers, customers & partners.
