While the Unified Checkout is pre-optimized for maximum conversions, it does not restrict you to stick to a one-size-fits-all approach. Using the SDK APIs, you get complete control over modifying the payment experience by,

- üìù **Including new fields to the payment form** on a single processor like Stripe or Braintree
- üí≥ **Prioritizing payment methods** by 90% to add & maintain integrations
- üé® **Switching themes and layouts of checkout page** with full visibility and control

## ‚ö°Ô∏è Quick Start Guide

Ways to get started with Hyperswitch:

### Try it in our Sandbox Environment: Fast and easy to start.

&nbsp; &nbsp; To integrate Hyperswitch into your project, follow these steps:

1.  **Register**: Begin by registering at [Hyperswitch](https://app.hyperswitch.io/register) to gain access to your dashboard.

1.  **Access Your Dashboard**: Once logged in, navigate to your dashboard's home page.

1.  **Find Your Keys**: In the sidebar, you can find your [API Keys](https://app.hyperswitch.io/developer-api-keys). Here, you can also generate your API Key. Additionally, your Publishable Key is available within the same section.

1.  **Integration**: After obtaining your Keys add them to your project's environment variables or configuration file for seamless integration.

### üõ†Ô∏è Try it in Local

&nbsp; &nbsp; Before you start the local setup, you need to understand a few configs -

- #### Env Configs for Demo App

  - **`HYPERSWITCH_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`:** The publishable key of your Hyperswitch account. This key will start with `pk_dev_` for local development, `pk_snd_` for sandbox, and `pk_prd_` for production.

  - **`HYPERSWITCH_SECRET_KEY`:** The API key of your Hyperswitch account that is used to authenticate API requests from your merchant server. On the Hyperswitch Dashboard, locate the "Developers" section, then click on [API Keys](https://app.hyperswitch.io/developer-api-keys). Here, you can generate your API Key.

  - **`HYPERSWITCH_SERVER_URL`:** The URL of your hosted Hyperswitch backend server. Alternatively, you can use our Sandbox URL (https://sandbox.hyperswitch.io) or specify your backend running locally (e.g., http://localhost:8080).

  - **`HYPERSWITCH_CLIENT_URL`:** The URL of your hosted Hyperswitch SDK. You can also use our Sandbox URL (https://beta.hyperswitch.io/v1) or specify your app running locally (e.g., http://localhost:9050).

  - **`SELF_SERVER_URL`:** The URL of the hosted server file for generating client-secret and for fetching urls & configs. (eg: http://localhost:9060/payments)

- #### Env Configs for SDK

  - **`ENV_BACKEND_URL`:** Sets the endpoint for all the APIs used within the SDK to interact with the backend service. If you are running your own backend service, you can configure and specify its endpoint here for local setups.

  - **`ENV_LOGGING_URL`:** Specifies a custom logging endpoint where logs generated by the SDK can be sent. This allows you to view and manage logs according to your requirements.

  ### Setup Node

  Check if your machine has node already installed by running the below command on your local machine.

  ```bash
  node -v
  ```

  If your machine does not have node installed in it, you can install it from [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download)

    <h3>Clone the repo</h3>

  Clone the repository from Bitbucket and save in your folder.

  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/juspay/hyperswitch-web.git
  cd hyperswitch-web
  ```

  ### Setup the repo

  1. First install all the node modules by running the following command

     ```bash
     npm install
     ```

  2. Once the installation is successful, you can open two terminals.<br>

     - On the first terminal run the following command for generating the build:

       ```bash
       npm run re:start
       ```

     - On the second terminal, run the following command for starting the server.

       ```bash
         npm run start
       ```

     Upon success, you should see a message _Compiled successfully_ message on both of your terminals.

  3. Now that the build is generated successfully, on a third terminal, launch the playground.

     ```bash
     cd Hyperswitch-React-Demo-App
     npm install
     npm run start
     ```

     This will open a demo app where you can test your payments.

  > üí° Alternatively, you can update `.env` file and use the commands
  > above

## ‚õÅ Backend Server

There are two ways to set up the backend:

- ### Local Setup

  - Install in your local system: Configurations and setup required in your system. Suitable if you like to customise the core offering, [learn more](https://github.com/juspay/hyperswitch/blob/main/docs/try_local_system.md)

  - If you are running our backend locally, you can use our [Postman Collection](https://github.com/juspay/hyperswitch/blob/main/docs/try_local_system.md#try-out-our-apis) for generating the API Key and Publishable Key.

- ### Custom Backend

  For configuring `customBackendUrl`, when calling Hyper function you can pass the customBackendUrl in props

  In Payment.js file -

  ```javascript
  window.Hyper(publishableKey, {
    customBackendUrl: `CUSTOM_BACKEND_URL`,
  });
  ```

  **Warning:** Please maintain API compatibility of your server and web app. If any API contracts are manually changed without the corresponding handling in the SDK, there is a possibility of the application not working as expected. Please ensure that you use the compatible versions. The latest [releases](https://github.com/juspay/hyperswitch/releases) will have the additional details of the compatible versions of the app server, web app, and the control center.

## üìä Custom Logging

Logging from the payment checkout web client is crucial for tracking and monitoring the flow of payments. It provides a transparent record of events, errors, and user interactions, aiding developers and support teams in identifying issues, debugging, and ensuring the security and reliability of payment processes. Well-implemented logging enhances traceability and facilitates a more efficient resolution of potential problems in the payment checkout experience.

Logs are sent to the server via non-blocking Beacon API requests. This means that even if the logging endpoint configured is incorrect, it would not affect the core payment functionalities. You can find more about the structure of logging request payload in the `beaconApiCall` function in the [`OrcaLogger.res`](./src/orca-log-catcher/OrcaLogger.res#L423C7-L423C20) file.

If you want to collect logs, you can do so by setting up an endpoint on your server to receive, process and persist logs.

In the [`webpack.common.js`](./webpack.common.js) file, you would have to enable the logging flag, and configure the logging endpoint and log level.

```javascipt
let logEndpoint =
  sdkEnv === "prod"
    ? "<YOUR_PRODUCTION_LOGGING_ENDPOINT>"
    : "<YOUR_SANDBOX_LOGGING_ENDPOINT>";

// Set this to true to enable logging
let enableLogging = true;

// Choose from DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, SILENT
let loggingLevel = "DEBUG";
```

Now let's test the integration by making a payment from your web client!

### ü§ù Our Belief

> Payments should be open, fast, reliable and affordable to serve
> the billions of people at scale.

Globally payment diversity has been growing at a rapid pace.
There are hundreds of payment processors and new payment methods like BNPL,
RTP etc.
Businesses need to embrace this diversity to increase conversion, reduce cost
and improve control.
But integrating and maintaining multiple processors needs a lot of dev effort.
Why should devs across companies repeat the same work?
Why can't it be unified and reused? Hence, Hyperswitch was born to create that
reusable core and let companies build and customise it as per their specific requirements.

### ‚ú® Our Values

1. Embrace Payments Diversity: It will drive innovation in the ecosystem in
   multiple ways.
2. Make it Open Source: Increases trust; Improves the quality and reusability of
   software.
3. Be community driven: It enables participatory design and development.
4. Build it like Systems Software: This sets a high bar for Reliability,
   Security and Performance SLAs.
5. Maximise Value Creation: For developers, customers & partners.
